# Cartogram-Questionaire

This project is an interactive web-based application designed to evaluate the suitability of different cartogram types for spatial data presentation. The goal of this application is to determine which cartogram designs are most easily understood by the general public, helping to improve the effectiveness of spatial data visualization.

## Purpose
This project aims to provide an intuitive, data-driven approach to evaluate the effectiveness of different cartogram visualizations, helping users understand which spatial representations are best for public-facing data communication.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Questionnaires:** The application generates objective questionnaires to assess user comprehension of different cartogram types. Each questionnaire is mapped to corresponding cartogram images, allowing for clear and direct assessment.

- **Modular Design:** All components (questionnaires, image generation, and data handling) are designed to be atomic and independent. This ensures flexibility and ease of maintenance, allowing new questions and image models to be added or modified without affecting the entire application.

- **No-SQL Database Integration:** Data from user responses is stored in Deta, a lightweight and scalable No-SQL database. This ensures efficient storage and retrieval of assessment data.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Data collected from the assessment is exported to Excel using Google Colab for further statistical analysis. This helps in deriving insights into which cartogram types work best for various spatial datasets.

- **Streamlit Deployment:** The entire application is built and deployed using Streamlit, a popular Python framework for creating fast and interactive web applications. The deployment ensures easy access for users to participate in the assessments without any setup requirements.


## Tech Stack

- **Python:** Core language for building the logic and components of the application.
- **Streamlit:** Framework for creating and deploying the web application.
- **Deta (No-SQL):** Database used for storing user responses.
- **Google Colab & Excel:** For data analysis and generating statistical insights.
